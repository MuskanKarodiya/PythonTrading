# **Algorithmic Trading Bot with Python and Fyers API**

## **Project Overview**
This project is an **algorithmic trading bot** that uses **Fyers API** to fetch daily stock market data and apply a trading algorithm to generate **buy, sell, or hold signals**. The bot integrates with the Fyers API to retrieve historical and real-time stock data and can optionally execute trades based on the algorithm's output.

### **Key Features**:
- Fetch historical and real-time stock market data from Fyers.
- Implement a simple trading strategy (such as **moving average crossover**).
- Generate **buy/sell/hold** signals based on the trading algorithm.
- Automate trade execution (optional).
- Schedule the bot to run at the start of every trading day.


## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Core programming language for the bot.
- **Fyers API**: For fetching stock data and executing trades.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **Requests**: For making API calls to Fyers.
